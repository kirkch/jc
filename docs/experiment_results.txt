--------------------------------

rationale:  resizing a file as it expands is expensive; is buffering the entire
            file before streaming to disk faster

conclusion: yes for small files, no for big files; and in either case
            incremental buffering is fastest

future idea:  is an off heap version of BufferedOutputStream kinda to the GC?
              or one that reuses the byte array file after file.
              rationale being that large byte arrays would get tenured prematurely.

                                             small file (ns),  big file (ns)
approach 1: custom linked list byte buffer        950000,         1566000
approach 2: no buffer                            1772000,         1285000
approach 3: standard BufferedOutputStream         344000,          967000
